      subtitle: 'Building AI Solutions with Limitless Possibilities'
      text: |-
        I'm an ML Engineer and Software Engineer 3 at Tune AI, specializing in developing and deploying machine learning models and distributed systems for real-world applications. My work focuses on creating robust AI solutions that solve complex problems and drive business value.

        ### Key Areas of Expertise:
        - **Generative AI & LLMs**: Building high-throughput proxy servers handling over 1M requests/day for OpenAI, Anthropic, and other LLM providers
        - **Document Processing**: Developing multimodal extraction pipelines processing 100K+ documents daily with ~95% precision/recall
        - **Cloud Infrastructure**: Creating flexible, scalable infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure using Kubernetes and IaC
        - **MLOps**: Implementing robust monitoring, logging, and deployment pipelines for ML systems

        The name "Kausky" comes from Aakash (meaning "sky" in Hindi) and Kaushik (surname, "kau") -> kausky. This represents my vision of building AI solutions with limitless possibilities.
